# graphical-models-for-boundary-detection
This is a repository containing all the codes used in "Detecting Spatial Health Disparities Using Disease Maps - Aiello &amp; Banerjee"

The data analysis folder contains the data along with the three settings under which the analysis was conducted. For all of the three cases it was used the unstructured disease graph:
- MDAGAR1: covariates both in the mean structure and in the adjacency model
- MDAGAR2: covariates only in the adjacency model
- MDAGAR3: covariates only in the mean structure

The simulation folder contains the codes used to produce the results shown in the manuscript. In particular there are the data simulation, the simulation and the assessment for each disease graphical model:
- unstructured
- directed
- undirected
